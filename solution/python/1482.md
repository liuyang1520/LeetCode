## Problem
[1482. Minimum Number of Days to Make m Bouquets](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-days-to-make-m-bouquets/)

## Solution
The difficulty of this problem is that the bloom day might change and we need to find the min value.
Imagine that if we have limit for the time, then we can find whether current `bloomDay` is valid or not in O(n).
So by applying binary search on the time range from `[0, max(bloomDay)]`, we can locate the min value. Total time complexity O(log(max(bloomDay)) * n).

## Implementation
```python
class Solution:
    def minDays(self, bloomDay: List[int], m: int, k: int) -> int:
        length = len(bloomDay)
        if length < m * k:
            return -1
        left, right = 0, max(bloomDay)
        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            isValid = False
            subsum, cur, width = 0, 0, 0
            while cur < length:
                if bloomDay[cur] <= mid:
                    width += 1
                else:
                    width = 0
                if width == k:
                    subsum += 1
                    width = 0
                if subsum >= m:
                    isValid = True
                    break
                cur += 1
            if isValid:
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        return left
```
