## Problem
[1710. Maximum Units on a Truck](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-units-on-a-truck/)

## Solution
The problem looks like a knapsack problem, however, it has the greedy solution, as box with more units doesn't need more space.

## Implementation
```python
class Solution:
    def maximumUnits(self, boxTypes: List[List[int]], truckSize: int) -> int:
        boxTypes = sorted(boxTypes, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        res = 0
        for count, value in boxTypes:
            if count <= truckSize:
                res += count * value
                truckSize -= count
            else:
                res += truckSize * value
                return res
        return res
```
