## Problem
[1277. Count Square Submatrices with All Ones](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-square-submatrices-with-all-ones/)

## Solution
At first glance, I think this might be a DP problem, however, I didn't think too much in the DP way.

Instead I tried to implement what the problem ask us to do without counting duplicate squares.
For every node in the graph, we treat it as the left-upper corner of square, then by adding a new row/column, we recompute whether it can form a square.
This will reduce the nodes involved in recompute, comparing the normal approach of recomputing the whole square.
See the implementation below. This solution is not the best solution for this problem.

for the DP solution.

## Implementation
```python
class Solution:
    def countSquares(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        xmax, ymax = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        res = 0
        for x in range(xmax):
            for y in range(ymax):
                # treat each node as the left-upper corner of square
                for d in range(min(xmax - x, ymax - y)):
                    # new row
                    if any(matrix[x + d][i] == 0 for i in range(y, y + d + 1)):
                        break
                    # new column
                    if any(matrix[i][y + d] == 0 for i in range(x, x + d + 1)):
                        break
                    res += 1
        return res
```
