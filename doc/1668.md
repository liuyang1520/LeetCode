## Problem
[1668. Maximum Repeating Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-repeating-substring/)

## Solution
The solution below is easy, just need to keep appending word then check whether it is in the sequence.

Some suggestion for improvements:
- binary search for the word count
- KMP algorithm

## Implementation
```python
class Solution:
    def maxRepeating(self, sequence: str, word: str) -> int:
        temp = word
        res = 0
        while len(temp) <= len(sequence):
            if temp in sequence:
                res += 1
            temp += word
        return res
```
