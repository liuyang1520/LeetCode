## Problem
[1014. Best Sightseeing Pair](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-sightseeing-pair/)

## Solution
Try the brute-force with O(n^2), get TLE.

The problem asks us to find the max `A[i] + A[j] + i - j`, we can seperate it into `A[i] + i + A[j] - j`.
We iterate the list, for every `A[j] - j`, we check whether it is the optimal one, as `i < j`, we should store the max `A[i] + i` information and check it too.
In this way, we can get the answer in O(n).

## Implementation
```python
class Solution:
    def maxScoreSightseeingPair(self, A: List[int]) -> int:
        maxScore = 0
        prevMax = 0
        for i in range(len(A)):
            maxScore = max(A[i] - i + prevMax, maxScore)
            prevMax = max(A[i] + i, prevMax)
        return maxScore
```
