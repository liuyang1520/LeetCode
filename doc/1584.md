## Problem
[1584. Min Cost to Connect All Points](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-to-connect-all-points/)

## Solution
By reading the input size, `1 <= points.length <= 1000`, we know that it cannot be a DFS solution as the exponential time complexity will time out for sure.

Trying to find a greedy solution, and make sure it works. The steps are below:
- initiate a `used` group of points with first point (can be any random point), and a `not used` group of points for the others
- calculate all the distance of points between the two groups
- find the min distance, move the point from `not used` to `used` group
- repeat the above steps until `not used` group is empty

The first code block below implements the above solution. It is a correct solution, however, it gets TLE. So we need to improve it.

Note that we don't need to recalculate all the distance of points for the points already in the `used` group, as those have been calculated in last rounds.

The steps can be improved as follows:
- initiate a `last used` point with first point (can be any random point), and a `not used` group of points for the others
- calculate all the distance of points between the `last used` point and the points in `not used` group
- find the min distance with the point, update the `last used` point to the point and remove it from `not used` group
- repeat the above steps until `not used` group is empty

As we tracks the previous distance calculations, we reduce the time complexity from O(n^3) to O(n^2), see the second code block for AC solution.

## Implementation
```python
# TLE
class Solution:
    def minCostConnectPoints(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        points = list(map(tuple, points))
        used = {points[0]}
        notUsed = set(points[1:])
        res = 0
        while notUsed:
            xm, ym, minDist = 0, 0, float("inf")
            for xn, yn in notUsed:
                for xu, yu in used:
                    dist = abs(xn - xu) + abs(yn - yu)
                    if dist < minDist:
                        xm, ym, minDist = xn, yn, dist
            used.add((xm, ym))
            notUsed.remove((xm, ym))
            res += minDist
        return res
```

    def minCostConnectPoints(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:

        notUsed = set(points[1:])
        lastUsedPoint = points[0]
        distToLastUsedPoint = { (x, y): float("inf") for x, y in points }
        res = 0
        while notUsed:
            for xn, yn in notUsed:
                xu, yu = lastUsedPoint
                dist = abs(xn - xu) + abs(yn - yu)
                distToLastUsedPoint[(xn, yn)] = min(dist, distToLastUsedPoint[(xn, yn)])
            xm, ym, minDist = 0, 0, float("inf")
            for x, y in distToLastUsedPoint:
                if distToLastUsedPoint[(x, y)] < minDist:
                    xm, ym, minDist = x, y, distToLastUsedPoint[(x, y)]
            lastUsedPoint = (xm, ym)
            notUsed.remove(lastUsedPoint)
            distToLastUsedPoint[lastUsedPoint] = float("inf")
            res += minDist
        return res
```
