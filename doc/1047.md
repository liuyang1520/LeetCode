## Problem
[1047. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-all-adjacent-duplicates-in-string/)

## Solution
This problem is similar to the `parentheses` problems, for example, [20. Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/).
We can use a `stack` to help remove the adjacent duplicates by iterating and pushing in all the characters one by one.

## Implementation
```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, S: str) -> str:
        stack = []
        for c in S:
            if stack and stack[-1] == c:
                stack.pop()
                continue
            stack.append(c)
        return "".join(stack)
```
