## Problem
[1248. Count Number of Nice Subarrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-nice-subarrays/)

## Solution
With one iteration, we can pre-calculate 2 things:
- how many odds from the start to current positions
- for each odd sum, what is the low/high index

With the pre-calculated data, we can easily calculate the subarray numbers.

- [Java/C++ with picture, deque](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-nice-subarrays/discuss/419545/JavaC%2B%2B-with-picture-deque)

## Implementation
```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfSubarrays(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        oddSums = []
        sumWidth = {0: [-1, -1]}
        for i, val in enumerate(nums):
            if val % 2:
                count += 1
            oddSums.append(count)
            if count not in sumWidth:
                sumWidth[count] = [i, i]
            else:
                sumWidth[count][1] = i
        res = 0
        for i in range(0, len(oddSums)):
            if oddSums[i] < k:
                continue
            diff = oddSums[i] - k
            if diff in sumWidth:
                x, y = sumWidth[diff]
                res += y - x + 1
        return res
```
