## Problem
[1447. Simplified Fractions](https://leetcode.com/problems/simplified-fractions/)

## Solution
By iterating all the value pairs for numerator and denominator, we can find all the combinations in O(n^2).
The problem here is to identify whether it is a simplified fraction. There are two ways to do it.

- Use [Euclidean algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm) to get the greatest common divisor in O(logn), then judge whether it is a good one
- Use a `set` to store all visited values, for example, `1/2` is visited, we store `2/1 = 2`, then `2/4` should be skipped as it has been visited before, time complexity for this is O(1)


## Implementation
```python
# GCD solution
class Solution:
    def simplifiedFractions(self, n: int) -> List[str]:
        res = []
        def gcd(a, b):
            if a < b:
                a, b = b, a
            if b == 0:
                return a
            return gcd(a % b, b)

        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            for j in range(1, i):
                if j == 1 or gcd(i, j) == 1:
                    res.append(f"{j}/{i}")
        return res
```

```python
# set solution
class Solution:
    def simplifiedFractions(self, n: int) -> List[str]:
        res = []
        visitedValues = set()
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            for j in range(1, i):
                value = i / j
                if value not in visitedValues:
                    res.append(f"{j}/{i}")
                    visitedValues.add(value)
        return res
```
