## Problem
[837. New 21 Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/new-21-game/)

## Solution
It is easy to find that the probability of reaching value `x`, namely `f(x)`, has the relationship that `f(x) = sum(f(x - i) / W), 1 <= i <= W`.
Based on this, we come up with the first DP implementation. However, it got TLE.

We can improve the first implementation by keeping a subsum of probabilities with a sliding window of size W.

## Implementation
```python
# DP, O(K * W), TLE
class Solution:
    def new21Game(self, N: int, K: int, W: int) -> float:
        dp = [0] * (N + 1)
        dp[0] = 1
        length = len(dp)
        for i in range(0, K):
            for d in range(1, min(length - i, W + 1)):
                j = i + d
                dp[j] += dp[i] / W
        return sum(dp[i] for i in range(K, N + 1))
```

```python
class Solution:
    def new21Game(self, N: int, K: int, W: int) -> float:
        if K == 0:
            return 1
        dp = [0] * (N + 1)
        dp[0] = 1
        subp = 1
        for i in range(1, N + 1):
            dp[i] = subp / W
            if i < K:
                subp += dp[i]
            if i >= W:
                subp -= dp[i - W]
        return sum(dp[i] for i in range(K, N + 1))
```
