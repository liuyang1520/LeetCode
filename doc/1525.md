## Problem
[1525. Number of Good Ways to Split a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-good-ways-to-split-a-string/)

## Solution
Intuitively, after reading the problem description, we want to pre-calculate two arrays storing how many different letters counting from both ends of the string.

To achieve this, we can get the pre-calculated array with a `Set`, `Dict`, or even `Counter` in Python3 by iterating the whole string.

Finally, we need to iterate the pre-calculated arrays to comparing the results, then get the final answer.

The implementation below can be improved to a single iteration, while the time complexity remains the same O(n).

## Implementation
```python
class Solution:
    def numSplits(self, s: str) -> int:
        diffLetterStats, revDiffLetterStats = [], []
        temp = set()
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            temp.add(s[i])
            diffLetterStats.append(len(temp))
        temp = set()
        for i in range(len(s) - 1, 0, -1):
            temp.add(s[i])
            revDiffLetterStats.insert(0, len(temp))
        res = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if diffLetterStats[i] == revDiffLetterStats[i]:
                res += 1
        return res
```
