## Problem
[206. Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)

## Solution
Solution 1, we create dummy previous node to track the left node, and update the links on the fly.

Solution 2, we use a stack to track all previous nodes, and do the reverse with the stack pop.

## Implementation
```python
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        prev = None
        while head:
            nextNode = head.next
            head.next = prev
            prev = head
            head = nextNode
        return prev
```

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        if not head:
            return head
        stack = []
        while head:
            stack.append(head)
            head = head.next
        head = stack[-1]
        while stack:
            top = stack.pop()
            if stack:
                top.next = stack[-1]
            else:
                top.next = None
        return head
```
