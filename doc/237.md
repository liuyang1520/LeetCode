## Problem
[237. Delete Node in a Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-linked-list/)

## Solution
The problem doesn't provide the previous node of the to be deleted node.

After some thoughts, find that we can shift the values 1 index ahead, and remove the last node, it takes O(n).

Also, we can just move next node's value to current node, this idea makes the previous node available to us.

## Implementation
```python
class Solution:
    def deleteNode(self, node):
        """
        :type node: ListNode
        :rtype: void Do not return anything, modify node in-place instead.
        """
        prev = node
        while node.next:
            node.val = node.next.val
            prev = node
            node = node.next
        prev.next = None
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def deleteNode(self, node):
        """
        :type node: ListNode
        :rtype: void Do not return anything, modify node in-place instead.
        """
        node.val = node.next.val
        node.next = node.next.next
```
