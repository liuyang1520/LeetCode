## Problem
[1557. Minimum Number of Vertices to Reach All Nodes](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-vertices-to-reach-all-nodes/)

## Solution
This problem is asking us to find all the sources in the graph. Every source has no in-coming edges, so the in-degree is zero.

## Implementation
```python
class Solution:
    def findSmallestSetOfVertices(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        graph = [False] * n
        for fromV, toV in edges:
            graph[toV] = True
        return [i for i in range(n) if not graph[i]]
```
