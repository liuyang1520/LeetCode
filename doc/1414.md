## Problem
[1414. Find the Minimum Number of Fibonacci Numbers Whose Sum Is K](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-minimum-number-of-fibonacci-numbers-whose-sum-is-k/)

## Solution
Intuitively, I think there should be a greedy solution. Try to greedily pick up the largest Fibonacci number smaller than k.

## Implementation
```python
class Solution:
    def findMinFibonacciNumbers(self, k: int) -> int:
        fibs = []
        a, b = 1, 1
        while b <= k:
            fibs.append(b)
            a, b = b, a + b
        count = 0
        while k > 0:
            for i in range(len(fibs) - 1, -1, -1):
                if fibs[i] <= k:
                    count += 1
                    k -= fibs[i]
        return count
```
