## Problem
[1588. Sum of All Odd Length Subarrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-all-odd-length-subarrays/)

## Solution
If we follow the problem description to calculate the sums of sub-arrays, then sum together, the total time complexity is O(n^3).

Instead of finding all the sub-arrays, we just need to find how many times each number is used in the sub-arrays.

To do this, we find the max/min right-most indexes containing the current number, to calculate how many times this number is used.
The time complexity is O(n^2).

Actually, there is O(n) solution, by simplifying the calculation with some math: [[Java/C++/Python] O(N) Time, O(1) Space](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-all-odd-length-subarrays/discuss/854184/JavaC%2B%2BPython-O(N)-Time-O(1)-Space)

## Implementation
```python
class Solution:
    def sumOddLengthSubarrays(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        length = len(arr)
        for i in range(length):
            l = 0
            while l < length:
                res += arr[i] * (min(i + l, length - 1) - max(l, i) + 1)
                l += 2
        return res
```
