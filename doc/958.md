## Problem
[958. Check Completeness of a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-completeness-of-a-binary-tree/)

## Solution
After reading the question, I think it is a BFS problem.
We iterate the tree level by level, until we find a level that doesn't have left or right child, then all following nodes must be empty too.

The implementation below is lumbersome, I literally iterate the tree level by level, and fill in a double-sized array with next level nodes.

Note the edge case `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,null,null,15]`.

Some elegant implementations: [[Java/C++/Python] BFS Solution and DFS Soluiton](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-completeness-of-a-binary-tree/discuss/205682/JavaC%2B%2BPython-BFS-Solution-and-DFS-Soluiton)

## Implementation
```python
class Solution:
    def isCompleteTree(self, root: TreeNode) -> bool:
        queue = [root]
        isLastLevel = False
        while queue:
            temp = queue[:]
            queue = [None] * len(temp) * 2
            for index, node in enumerate(temp):
                if not node.left or not node.right:
                    isLastLevel = True
                if node.left:
                    queue[index * 2] = node.left
                if node.right:
                    queue[index * 2 + 1] = node.right
            if isLastLevel:
                switch = False
                for node in queue:
                    if node and (node.left or node.right):
                        return False
                    if (switch and node):
                        return False
                    if not node:
                        switch = True
                return True
        return True
```
