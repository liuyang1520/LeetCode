## Problem
[1641. Count Sorted Vowel Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-sorted-vowel-strings/)

## Solution
Imagine we have a function `f(x, y)`:
- `x` is the position count left, say initially we have `n` positions to fill, after we fill in the first position, it is `n-1`
- `y` is the count of characters we can use, initially it is `5`

We can come up with a iterative formula:
```
f(x, y) = sum(f(x-1, i), 1 <= i < y)
```

For example, when `n` is 3, and we have already filled in the first position with `e`, then we have 2 positions left with 4 characters (`a` is not feasible).
Now we have `f(2, 4) = f(1, 4)"eex" + f(1, 3)"eix" + f(1, 2)"eox" + f(1, 1)"eux"`, `f(1, 1) = 1` as we can only fill "u".

With this formula, we can quickly come up with the DP solution with bottom-up or top-down. The implementation below use the recursion with memorization.

## Implementation
```python
class Solution:
    def countVowelStrings(self, n: int) -> int:
        @lru_cache(maxsize=None)
        def helper(positionCount, charCount):
            if positionCount == 1:
                return charCount
            if charCount == 1:
                return 1
            total = 0
            for i in range(0, charCount):
                total += helper(positionCount - 1, charCount - i)
            return total
        return helper(n, 5)
```
