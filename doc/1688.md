## Problem
[1688. Count of Matches in Tournament](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-of-matches-in-tournament/)

## Solution
Usually, these problems have a math solution, which is much simpler.
This problem seems to ask us to find the sum of all sub-binary representations of a number.
If `x = 2^n`, then `1 + 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^n-1 = 2^n - 1`, so we can guess the result is close to `n-1`.
Let's read the examples provided in the problem, seems `n-1` works in those examples, including odd, even number. Try `n-1` and it is accepted.

## Implementation
```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfMatches(self, n: int) -> int:
        return n - 1
```
