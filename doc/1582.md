## Problem
[1582. Special Positions in a Binary Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/special-positions-in-a-binary-matrix/)

## Solution
To find the count of special positions as problem asks, we can brute-force the solution in O(n^3),
by iterating the matrix, for each element, iterate the row and column to check whether it is a special position.

We can improve the brute-force solution by pre-calculating the row/column sums for each row/column, in O(n^2).
Then iterate the matrix, use the pre-calculated results to check whether it is a special position, with total time complexity O(n^2).

## Implementation
```python
class Solution:
    def numSpecial(self, mat: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        xLen, yLen = len(mat), len(mat[0])
        rows = [0] * xLen
        cols = [0] * yLen
        for i in range(xLen):
            rows[i] = sum(mat[i])
        for j in range(yLen):
            cols[j] = sum(mat[i][j] for i in range(xLen))
        res = 0
        for i in range(xLen):
            for j in range(yLen):
                if mat[i][j] == 1 and rows[i] == 1 and cols[j] == 1:
                    res += 1
        return res
```
