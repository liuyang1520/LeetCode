## Problem
[1530. Number of Good Leaf Nodes Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-good-leaf-nodes-pairs/)

## Solution
To calculate the distance between each leaf pair, we need to store the distance to all its parents in the path to root.
After we retrieve this information for all the leaves, we can compare each pair to identify the valid ones.

Another way for solving this problem, we can postorder traverse the tree, for each node, we get all its leaves with the distance,
then we can calculate the results with a summation of all parent nodes during the traversal.

## Implementation
```python
class Solution:
    def countPairs(self, root: TreeNode, distance: int) -> int:
        from collections import defaultdict
        count = 1
        stack = [[{count: 0}, root]]
        leaf = []
        while stack:
            dist, node = stack.pop()
            newDist = {}
            for key in dist:
                newDist[key] = dist[key] + 1
            newDist[count] = 0
            if node.left:
                stack.append([newDist, node.left])
            if node.right:
                stack.append([newDist, node.right])
            if not node.left and not node.right:
                leaf.append(newDist)
            count += 1
        res = 0
        for i in range(len(leaf)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(leaf)):
                item1, item2 = leaf[i], leaf[j]
                for key in item1:
                    if key in item2 and item1[key] + item2[key] <= distance:
                        res += 1
                        break
        return res
```
