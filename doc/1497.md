## Problem
[1497. Check If Array Pairs Are Divisible by k](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-array-pairs-are-divisible-by-k/)

## Solution
My first intuition is to use a `Counter` (hash table) to avoid too many duplicates in the array.
See the first implementation, we need to iterate the keys with 2 nested for loop, total time complexity best case O(n), worst case O(n^2).
This implementation got TLE, which means we need to speed it up.

In math, we have `(i + j) % k == 0 => ((i % k) + (j % k)) % k == 0`. By running a map for all items in array with `i % k`, we project all items in number axis to `(-k, k)`.
Then there are only 3 ways that the pair sum works, `i + j = 0 or k or -k`. So we can improve the solution to O(n).

## Implementation
```python
# TLE
class Solution:
    def canArrange(self, arr: List[int], k: int) -> bool:
        if sum(arr) % k != 0: return False
        from collections import Counter
        counter = Counter(arr)
        keys = counter.keys()
        for i in keys:
            if counter[i] > 0:
                counter[i] -= 1
                canFind = False
                for j in keys:
                    if counter[j] > 0 and (i + j) % k == 0:
                        counter[j] -= 1
                        canFind = True 
                        break
                if not canFind:
                    return False
        return True
```

```python
# Accepted
class Solution:
    def canArrange(self, arr: List[int], k: int) -> bool:
        arr = [i % k for i in arr]
        if sum(arr) % k != 0: return False
        from collections import Counter
        counter = Counter(arr)
        keys = counter.keys()
        for i in keys:
            if counter[i] > 0:
                counter[i] -= 1
                canFind = False
                # i + j = 0 or k or -k
                for j in [k - i, -i, -k - i]:
                    if counter[j] > 0:
                        counter[j] -= 1
                        canFind = True 
                        break
                if not canFind:
                    return False
        return True
```
