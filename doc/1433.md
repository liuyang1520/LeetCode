## Problem
[1433. Check If a String Can Break Another String](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-a-string-can-break-another-string/)

## Solution
There are two solutions for this problem.

Solution 1 is sort and iteration, after sorting the two strings, we then compare both of them on each position to see whether one can break the other.
Time complexity: O(nlogn)

Solution 2, check [[Python] O(n)](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-a-string-can-break-another-string/discuss/608668/Python-O(n).) for implementation.
After counting all the characters, we compare the counts of characters in alphabetical order.
The key point is, if `s1` has more `a`s then it must have less other characters, we monitor whether this overwhelming will turn over, if not then it is a break.

## Implementation
```python
class Solution:
    def checkIfCanBreak(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
        s1 = "".join(sorted(s1))
        s2 = "".join(sorted(s2))
        return all(s1[i] >= s2[i] for i in range(len(s1))) or all(s2[i] >= s1[i] for i in range(len(s1)))
```
