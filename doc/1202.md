## Problem
[1202. Smallest String With Swaps](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-string-with-swaps/)

## Solution
Looking at the examples below:
```
Input: s = "dcab", pairs = [[0,3],[1,2],[0,2]]
Output: "abcd"

Input: s = "cba", pairs = [[0,1],[1,2]]
Output: "abc"
```
We can find that if we have `[0, 1]` and `[1, 2]` pairs, we can have `[0, 2]` as a new pair.
Basically, treat the string as a graph and the pairs as edges, as long as a node is connected to a sub-graph, then it can switch with any node in that sub-graph.

The idea behind this is quite similar to what union find does. We group the letters by its union find root, then sort the letters inside each group,
finally assemble the sorted string together.

## Implementation
```python
class Solution:
    def smallestStringWithSwaps(self, s: str, pairs: List[List[int]]) -> str:
        from collections import defaultdict
        class UnionFind:
            def __init__(self, n):
                self.p = list(range(n))
            def union(self, x, y):
                self.p[self.find(x)] = self.find(y)
            def find(self, x):
                if x != self.p[x]:
                    self.p[x] = self.find(self.p[x])
                return self.p[x]
        unionFind = UnionFind(len(s))
        res = []
        groupedLetters = defaultdict(list)
        for i, j in pairs:
            unionFind.union(i, j)
        for i, c in enumerate(s):
            groupedLetters[unionFind.find(i)].append(c)
        for key in groupedLetters:
            groupedLetters[key].sort()
        for i in range(len(s)):
            res.append(groupedLetters[unionFind.find(i)].pop(0))
        return "".join(res)
```
