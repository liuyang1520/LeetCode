## Problem
[1028. Recover a Tree From Preorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/recover-a-tree-from-preorder-traversal/)

## Solution
The input is a preorder traversal with DFS, hence we should be able to re-construct the tree with preorder DFS.

We use a stack to track the nodes along the path from current depth to root, and pops nodes when:
- peek of stack is not the `depth - 1` of upcoming node
- peek of stack doesn't have a branch to attach

The problem's input is also not very friendly, that's why we have a outer while loop to separate the dashes and values on the fly.

Another implementation with similar idea: [[Java/C++/Python] Iterative Stack Solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/recover-a-tree-from-preorder-traversal/discuss/274621/JavaC%2B%2BPython-Iterative-Stack-Solution)

## Implementation
```python
class Solution:
    def recoverFromPreorder(self, S: str) -> TreeNode:
        val, depth, i = "", 0, 0
        root = None
        stack = []
        while i < len(S):
            if S[i] != "-":
                while i < len(S) and S[i] != "-":
                    val += S[i]
                    i += 1
                treeNode = TreeNode(int(val))
                if depth == 0:
                    root = treeNode
                if stack:
                    while stack and stack[-1][1] != depth - 1:
                        stack.pop()
                    peekNode, peekDepth = stack[-1]
                    if not peekNode.left:
                        peekNode.left = treeNode
                    elif not peekNode.right:
                        peekNode.right = treeNode
                    else:
                        stack.pop()
                stack.append([treeNode, depth])
                depth = 0
                val = ""
            else:
                while i < len(S) and S[i] == "-":
                    depth += 1
                    i += 1
        return root
```
