## Problem
[1109. Corporate Flight Bookings](https://leetcode.com/problems/corporate-flight-bookings/)

## Solution
The brute-force solution is easy to come up with, see implementation 1, got TLE, O(n^2).

This problem has a O(n) solution, see [
C++/Java with picture, O(n)](https://leetcode.com/problems/corporate-flight-bookings/discuss/328871/C%2B%2BJava-with-picture-O(n)).
The idea is to perform a running sum finally with the delta at each position.

## Implementation
```python
# TLE
class Solution:
    def corpFlightBookings(self, bookings: List[List[int]], n: int) -> List[int]:
        mergedBookings = {}
        for start, end, count in bookings:
            if (start, end) not in mergedBookings:
                mergedBookings[(start, end)] = count
            else:
                mergedBookings[(start, end)] += count
        res = [0] * n
        for interval, count in mergedBookings.items():
            start, end = interval
            for i in range(start-1, end):
                res[i] += count
        return res

# AC
class Solution:
    def corpFlightBookings(self, bookings: List[List[int]], n: int) -> List[int]:
        runningSum = [0] * (n + 1)
        for start, end, count in bookings:
            runningSum[start-1] += count
            runningSum[end] -= count
        res = []
        subsum = 0
        for i in range(n):
            subsum += runningSum[i]
            res.append(subsum)
        return res
```
