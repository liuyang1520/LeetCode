## Problem
[1504. Count Submatrices With All Ones](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-submatrices-with-all-ones/)

## Solution
To avoid counting with duplicates, we can count all valid submatrices with the right-bottom as current node.

There are three parts of submatrices:
- vertial line, we can calculate with how many ones it has, e.g.,
```
0 1 0
0 1 0
0 1 0
```
- horizontal line, we can calculate with how many ones it has, e.g.,
```
0 0 0
1 1 1
0 0 0
```
- combined, e.g.,
```
0 0 0
1 1 0
1 1 0
```

To get how many combined submatrices, we need to check all columns before current one, or check all rows before current one.
The total time complexity is O(MNM).

The time complexity can be improved to O(MN) with a stack: [[Java] Detailed Explanation - From O(MNM) to O(MN) by using Stack](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-submatrices-with-all-ones/discuss/720265/Java-Detailed-Explanation-From-O(MNM)-to-O(MN)-by-using-Stack).

The idea is similar to calculating the area of histograms.

## Implementation
```python
class Solution:
    def numSubmat(self, mat: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        xmax, ymax = len(mat), len(mat[0])
        ones = [[[0, 0] for j in range(ymax + 1)] for i in range(xmax + 1)]
        res = 0
        for i in range(1, xmax + 1):
            for j in range(1, ymax + 1):
                if mat[i-1][j-1] == 1:
                    ones[i][j][0] = ones[i-1][j][0] + 1
                    ones[i][j][1] = ones[i][j-1][1] + 1
                    res += ones[i][j][0] + ones[i][j][1] - 1
                    k = j - 1
                    temp = ones[i][j][0]
                    while k - 1 >= 0 and mat[i-1][k-1] == 1 and min(ones[i][k][0], temp) > 1:
                        temp = min(ones[i][k][0], temp)
                        res += min(ones[i][k][0], temp) - 1
                        k -= 1
        return res
```
